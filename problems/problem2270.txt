b'The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:\n\nIt has a length of k.\nIt is a divisor of num.\n\nGiven integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.\nNote:\n\nLeading zeros are allowed.\n0 is not a divisor of any value.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = 240, k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:\n- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.\n- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.\nTherefore, the k-beauty is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = 430043, k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:\n- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.\n- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.\n- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.\nTherefore, the k-beauty is 2.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num <= 109\n1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)\n\n'
