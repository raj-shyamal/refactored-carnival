b'You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.\nnums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:\n\nThe sum of the first i + 1 elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last n - i - 1 elements.\nThere is at least one element to the right of i. That is, 0 <= i < n - 1.\n\nReturn the number of valid splits in nums.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [10,4,-8,7]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThere are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:\n- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.\nThus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,3,1,0]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThere are two valid splits in nums:\n- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [2,3], and its sum is 5. The second part is [1,0], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, i = 1 is a valid split. \n- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [2,3,1], and its sum is 6. The second part is [0], and its sum is 0. Since 6 >= 0, i = 2 is a valid split.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 105\n-105 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n'
