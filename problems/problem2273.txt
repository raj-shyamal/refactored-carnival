b'The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.\nGiven a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aababbb"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nAll possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:\n- Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b", "bb", and "bbb".\n- Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb", "aababbb", and "bab".\n- Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".\n- Variance 3 for substring "babbb".\nSince the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abcde"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nNo letter occurs more than once in s, so the variance of every substring is 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'
